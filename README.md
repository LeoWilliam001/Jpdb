# Project Management System

## Overview
The Project Management System is a web-based tool designed to make it easier for teams and organizations to manage their projects. It allows users to create, update, and track important project details like the project name, assigned team members, start dates, and deadlines. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system uses the Bootstrap framework to ensure a responsive and user-friendly design. On the backend, it uses JsonPowerDB for fast and efficient data storage, with AJAX powering real-time updates and smooth interactions.

## Why JsonPowerDB?
- **Fast & Efficient**: JsonPowerDB handles data quickly, which is essential for real-time project updates.
- **No Predefined Schema**: As a NoSQL database, JsonPowerDB doesnâ€™t require a fixed structure, making it flexible and adaptable to various data types.
- **Easy API Integration**: JsonPowerDB comes with built-in APIs that simplify data access, allowing developers to focus on building features instead of managing the database.
- **Advanced Querying**: Its powerful query capabilities make searching for specific data easy and efficient.
- **Lightweight**: JsonPowerDB is lightweight and easy to integrate into web apps without slowing them down.
